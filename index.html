								<p>Predicating your motivations upon God's standards is in itself aiming for the highest possible good that you can concieve of—free from all mortal standards that, by themselves are genuinely imperfect and are flawed to a certain degree. Though their bars are set up high for people who desire greatness, aiming the release of your best to the best of what has been concieved of by another mortal will perhaps never guarantee—or even allow—your transcendence of that standard. You can never be greater than your ideal.

								<p>Predicating your aims on God however, (though similar to predicating them on 
								standards of the flesh), is radically different in another dimension 
								in that you are free from the constraints of the univariate selectivity of 
								the mortal standards you are setting yourself up to. It's not to say that they are not themselves 
								in pursuit of greatness and excellence, but predicating yourself into the standard of sheer perfection allows
								you to be, following your abilities, greater than the standards set out by fellow humans in the suit of being a judge. 
								It has already been established that God is the greatest of all beings—and Him by Himself is already perfect, and He is The Judge. 
								We can never top God, if that hasn't been obvious already. Applying then the principles of the striving for greatness under God 
								guarantees us that we can be greater than who we are surrounded with, and most especially ourselves. 
								When you strive for greatness predicted merely on the standards of men, there is no striving higher in that given 
								hierarchy of competence with its given criteria for perfection or excellence. There lies a border in what can be considered as 
								the greatest achievement that you can achieve given that hierarchy. God's standard of perfection on the other hand allows for the 
								achievement of excellence limitlessly. Much like hell is a bottomless pit (and it's no wonder how bad things can become even worse 
								contrary to what we can actually concieve of), heaven as well is a ceilingless sky (much like great things can get even better 
								and better). Whatever greatness you have already accomplished now can be even greater than what you can actually concieve of, 
								given that you predicte yourself upon God's standard of perfection. Acknowledging the axiom that God is greater than us in all 
								dimensions and striving to be the closest we can to be with God in whatever dimension(s) that we can consciously concieve of 
								allows us to transcend our mortality, even just univariately. We become true manifestations of perfection in what we have chosen to become. 
								We can't actually be TRULY perfect, but being the closest we can to actual perfection is truly what to aim for. Acknowledging the fact that God, 
								though loving and forgiving with all our sins, judges us under his standards of perfection keeps us humble and perpetually striving for 
								greatness and closer to Him.</p>
